<h2>Donations</h2>

<p>Xdebug is a complicated piece of software, and has always been released
under an Open Source <a href='/license.php'>license</a>, and this will continue
into the far future. It has cost
<a href='http://derickrethans.nl/who.html'>me</a> thousands of hours to
develop, test and support Xdebug. If you find Xdebug valuable, I would
appreciate it if you would consider having a look at my Amazon <a
href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/registry/wishlist/SLCB276UZU8B'>Wishlist</a>. If
you want to donate something smaller, than an <a
href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B006AUF6X0/gcrnsts">Amazon Gift
Certificate from the UK store</a> <i>(to derick@xdebug.org)</i> is also very
welcome. I can sadly not use gift cards from other amazon stores (.de, .fr,
.com) as they don't work in the UK store.</p>
