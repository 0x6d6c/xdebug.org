<h2>Installing with PECL</h2>

<p>
You can install Xdebug through PECL on Linux &amp; macOS with Homebrew</sup>.
Run:
</p>
<pre class='example'>
pecl install xdebug
</pre>
<p class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> You should ignore any prompts to add
<code>"extension=xdebug.so"</code> to
<code>php.ini</code> &mdash; this <strong>will</strong> cause problems.</p>

<p>In some cases <code>pecl</code> will change the <code>php.ini</code> file to
add a configuration line to load Xdebug. You can check whether it did by
running <code>php -v</code>. If Xdebug shows up with a version number, than
you're all set and you can configure Xdebug's other functions, such as
[FEAT:step_debug], or [FEAT:profiler].</p>

<p>If <code>pecl</code> did not add the right line, skip to the <a
href='#configure-php'>Configure PHP</a> section.</p>

<p class='footnote'><sup>1</sup> On macOS, you should have PHP installed with <a href='https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/php'>Homebrew</a>.</p>

<a name='windows'></a>
<h2>Installing on Windows</h2>

<p>
There are a few precompiled modules for Windows, they are all for the non-debug
version of PHP. You can get those at the <a href='/download'>download</a>
page. Follow <a href='/wizard'>these instructions</a> to get Xdebug
installed.
</p>

<h2>Installation From Source</h2>

<a name='obtain'></a>
<h3>Obtain</h3>

<p>
You can <a href='/download#releases'>download</a> the source of the latest <b>stable</b> release [KW:last_release_version].
</p>
<p>
Alternatively you can obtain Xdebug from GIT:
</p>
<pre class='example'>
git clone git://github.com/xdebug/xdebug.git
</pre>
<p>
This will checkout the latest development version which is currently
[KW:last_dev_version]. This development branch might not always work as
expected, and may have bugs.
</p>
<p>
You can also browse the source on GitHub at <a
href='https://github.com/xdebug/xdebug'>https://github.com/xdebug/xdebug</a>.
</p>

<a name='compile'></a>
<h3>Compile</h3>

<p>There is a <a href='/wizard.php'>wizard</a> available that provides you
with the correct file to download, and which paths to use.</p>
<p>
You compile Xdebug separately from the rest of PHP. You need access to the
scripts <code>phpize</code> and <code>php-config</code>. If your system
does not have <code>phpize</code> and <code>php-config</code>, you will
need to install the PHP development headers.</p>
<p>
Debian users can do that with:
</p>
<pre class="example">
apt-get install php-dev
</pre>
<p>
And RedHat and Fedora users with:
</p>
<pre>
yum install php-devel
</pre>

<p>
It is important that the source version matches the installed version as there
are slight, but important, differences between PHP versions.  Once you have
access to <code>phpize</code> and <code>php-config</code>, take the
following steps:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li><p>Unpack the tarball:</p>
<p><code>tar -xzf xdebug-[KW:last_release_version].tgz</code></p>
<p>You should <strong>not</strong>
unpack the tarball inside the PHP source code tree.
Xdebug is compiled separately, all by itself, as stated above.</p></li>

<li><p><code>cd xdebug-[KW:last_release_version]</code></p></li>

<li><p><code>phpize</code></p>
<p>If phpize is not in your path, please make sure
that it is by expanding the <code>PATH</code> environment variable. Make sure
you use the phpize that belongs to the PHP version that you want to use Xdebug
with. See <a href='/docs/faq#api'>this FAQ entry</a> if you're having some
issues with finding which phpize to use.</p></li>

<li><p><code>./configure --enable-xdebug</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>make</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>make install</code></p></li>
</ol>

<a name='configure-php'></a>
<h3>Configure PHP</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Add the following line to <code>php.ini</code>:</p>
<p><code>zend_extension=/wherever/you/put/it/xdebug</code></p>

<p>To find out which <code>php.ini</code> file to modify, run a script with the
following:</p>
<pre>
&lt;?php
var_dump(php_ini_loaded_file(), php_ini_scanned_files());
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can run <code>php --ini</code> on the command line.</p>

<p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> There could be more than one
<code>php.ini</code> file. In many set-ups there is a different one for the
command line (often <code>cli/php.ini</code>) and the web server (often
<code>fpm/php.ini</code>).</p>

<p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> If you want to use Xdebug and
OPCache together, you must have the <code>zend_extension</code> line for Xdebug
below the line for OPCache. Otherwise, they won't work properly together.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Restart your webserver, or PHP-FPM, depending on what you are
using.</p></li>

<li><p>Verify that Xdebug is now loaded.</p>

<p>Create a PHP page that calls [FUNC:xdebug_info]. If you request the
page through the browser, it should show you an overview of Xdebug's settings
and log messages.</p>

<p>On the command line, you can also run <code>php -v</code>. Xdebug and its
version number should be present as in:</p>
<pre>
PHP 7.4.10 (cli) (built: Aug 18 2020 09:37:14) ( NTS DEBUG )
Copyright (c) The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.4.0, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies
  with Zend OPcache v7.4.10-dev, Copyright (c), by Zend Technologies
  with Xdebug v3.0.0-dev, Copyright (c) 2002-2020, by Derick Rethans
</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<p>With Xdebug loaded, you can now enable individual features, such as
[FEAT:remote], or [FEAT:profiler].</p>
