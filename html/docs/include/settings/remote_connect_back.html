<p>If enabled, the [CFG:remote_host] setting is ignored and Xdebug will
try to connect to the client that made the HTTP request. It checks the
<code>$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']</code> and
<code>$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']</code> variables to find out which IP address to
use.</p>

<p>If [CFG:remote_addr_header] is configured, then the <code>$SERVER</code>
variable with the configured name will be checked before the
<code>$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']</code> and
<code>$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']</code> variables.</p>

<p>This setting does not apply for debugging through the CLI, as the
<code>$SERVER</code> header variables are not available there.</p>

<p>Please note that there is <strong>no</strong> filter
available, and anybody who can connect to the webserver will then be able to
start a debugging session, even if their address does not match
[CFG:remote_host].</p>
