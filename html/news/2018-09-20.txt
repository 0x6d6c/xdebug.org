Xdebug 2.7.0beta1 released!
<p>This is the first release with PHP 7.3 support.</p>

<p>This release only updates Xdebug to support PHP 7.3. There are a few known
issues that still need to be addressed, such as a problem with Code Coverage
and multiple catches. These will be addressed in a future beta or Release
Candidate.</p>

<p>The full list of changes can be found on the <a
href="/updates.php#x_2_7_0beta1">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>Please test this release with PHP 7.3, and if you find problems, please
report them through the <a href="https://bugs.xdebug.org">issue tracker</a>.

<p>The source code and Windows binaries can be found on the
<a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>

<p>This release features community contributions by:

<p>With this new release out, perhaps now it is the time to contribute to
Xdebug's development by becoming a patron on
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/derickr">Patreon</a>. I spend countless hours
on Xdebug in my spare time, and if Xdebug has saved you loads of time, perhaps
you can spare a few Quid?</p>
