Xdebug 2.5.5 is out!
<p>This release fixes three issues with Code Coverage where Xdebug did not 
mark the covered lines correctly.</p>

<p>The full change log can be found on the <a
href="/updates.php#x_2_5_5">updates</a> page. The source code can be found
on the <a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>

<p>If you find Xdebug a valuable tool, you might want to look at my Amazon <a
href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/registry/wishlist/SLCB276UZU8B'>wishlist</a>.</p>
