<p>This is the first released to support PHP 7.1.</p>

<p>Besides support for PHP 7.1, it also adds support for IPv6. A few bugs have
been fixed as well.</p>

href="/updates.php#x_2_5_0">updates</a> page. The source code can be found
on the <a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>
