Xdebug 2.2.3 is out!
<p>This is a bug-fix release for the 2.2 series. The main feature is support
for PHP 5.5 but it also addresses a few minor other issues.</p>

<p>The full change log can be found on the <a
href="/updates.php#x_2_2_3">updates</a> page and the source code and Windows
binaries can be found on the <a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page.</p>

<p>I've also recently added the option of <a href='/buy-support.php'>buying a
"support" contact</a>. If you find Xdebug a valuable tool, you might want to
look into this to support Xdebug's development, or have a look at
my Amazon <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/registry/wishlist/SLCB276UZU8B'>wishlist</a>.</p>
