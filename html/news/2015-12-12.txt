Xdebug 2.4.0RC3 is out!
<p>This is the third release candidate of the 2.4 series. The 2.4 series adds
support for PHP 7 and is in large parts a rewrite of the earlier code base to
support PHP 5.4 through PHP 7.0. This release candidate fixes weird
optimisation issues with GCC 4.8, and should make everything work will on
Windows due to issue with changes in "long".</p>

<p>The full change log can be found on the <a
href="/updates.php#x_2_4_0RC3">updates</a> page. The source code can be found
on the <a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>

<p>If you find Xdebug a valuable tool, you might want to look at my Amazon <a
