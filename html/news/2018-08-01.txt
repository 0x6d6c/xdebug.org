<p>This is the first bug fix release of the 2.6 series.</p>

<p>This release fixes several crash bugs, a memory leak, and an issue with
step debugging where object properties with numerical names could not be
inspected.</p>

href="/updates.php#x_2_6_1">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>The source code and Windows binaries can be found on the
<a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page, and as usual, Xdebug is
installable through PECL.</p>

<p>With this new release out, perhaps now it is the time to contribute to
Xdebug's development by becoming a patron on
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/derickr">Patreon</a>. I spend countless hours
on Xdebug in my spare time, and if Xdebug has saved you loads of time, perhaps
you can spare a few Quid?</p>
