Xdebug 2.2.0 is out!
<p>This is the first version of Xdebug that supports PHP
5.4. Besides PHP 5.4 support, this release introduces a few new features into
Xdebug.  The main one is support for an overloaded var_dump() on the command
line. For other improvements, please refer to the <a
href="/updates.php#x_2_2_0">updates</a> page.</p>

<p>The full change log can be found on the <a
href="/updates.php#x_2_2_0">updates</a> page and the source code and Windows
binaries can be found on the <a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page.</p>

<p>I've also recently added the option of <a href='/buy-support.php'>buying a
"support" contact</a>. If you find Xdebug a valuable tool, you might want to
look into this to support Xdebug's development.</p>
