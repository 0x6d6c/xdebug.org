<p>This is the second release candidate of Xdebug 2.2

href="/updates.php#x_2_2_0rc2">updates</a> page and the source code and Windows
binaries can be found on the <a href="/download.php">downloads</a> page.</p>

<p>Please note that this is a <b>release candidate</b> and not guaranteed to be
free of bugs. If you have issues, please file them in <a
href="http://bugs.xdebug.org/bug_report_page.php">the issue tracker</a>. Please
try to provide enough information so that I can reproduce the issue. See <a
href="/support.php">here</a> for some hints.</p>

<p>I've also recently added the option of <a href='/buy-support.php'>buying a

look into this to support Xdebug's development.</p>
